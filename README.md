# Software Carpentry - Open Science Grid (SWC-OSG) Workshop

We work directly on the `gh-pages` as it is useful for the website 
rendering. GitHub renders the website from the HTML and markdown 
files kept under `gh-pages`. For example, the HTML and 
markdown files of this branch are rendered at the url: 
CurrentWebPage(http://swc-osg-workshop.github.io/general/). Since we want all the edits are 
displayed on the webpage and available to the participants, we want to directly work 
on `gh-pages`. This is the standard practice recomended by the software carpentry. 

The `general/gh-pages` repo contains the basic learning modules and necessary 
tools to set up new websites for the up-comping worshops. In this repo, we will 
update all the new materials and make generic changes to the woskshop front page. 

The sections below explain:

* __How to set up the git repo on your local machine.__
* __How do we edit the course materials.__
* __How do we edit the workshop front page.__
* __How do we create a new repo for a new workshop.__

## Getting Started


Now let us see how to make a copy of the existing repo on your locale machine.  In your local 
desktop or laptop, clone the repo 

```
git clone https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/general.git
```

and create new branch named `gh-pages`.

```
git checkout -b gh-pages
```

Now pull the content repository's `gh-pages` branch into your desktop repository:

```
git pull origin gh-pages
```

## Lesson Material

The current material is in the directories under `novice`. The shell and Git materials are 
written in Markdown, while the Python and SQL use the IPython Notebook. 

The material related to OSG is in the directory `novice/DHTC` and are written in Markdown.  Once 
finished editing the material at `novice/DHTC/filename.md`, push the content to the repository:

```
git add filename.md
git commit -m "some message here about the changes " 
git push origin gh-pages
```


## Workshop Front Page


Editing workshop front page involves editing html pages. Two html files are of 
primary interest to us. One is the "index.html" and other is "_includes/setup.html".


Edit `index.html` to make any changes to the workshop home page.
    In particular, the variables such as venue, date etc., in the page's header,
    as these are used to update the main website, and make sure the website-content is correct.
    You can use the script `./bin/swc_index_validator.py` to 
    check `index.html` for problems
    by running the command `make check`.


Edit `_includes/setup.html` to provide software installation instructions for the workshop attendees.

Once finished editing the index.html, push content to the repository:

```
git add index.html
git commit -m "some message here about the changes " 
git push origin gh-pages
```

As soon as the repo has been pushed to GitHub, GitHub will render the pages
at the [url](http://swc-osg-workshop.github.io/general)

## New Repo for a New Workshop

As soon as the workshop date is finalized, create a repo by the name
`YYYY-MM-DD`, where `YYYY` is the year, `MM` is the month and `DD` is the
date of the workshop. The new repo  - `YYYY-MM-DD` should have the materials for the 
workshop. The required materials already exist in `general` repo. Therefore we copy 
the course material and web content from the `general` repo.  This can done in your local 
Desktop or Laptop, type
the followings

```
git clone https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/YYYY-MM-DD.git
cd YYYY-MM-DD 
git checkout -b gh-pages 
git remote add general https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/general.git 
git pull general gh-pages 
git remote remove general 
```

Now you will have to change the workshop front page in the current repo `YYYY-MM-DD.git` as 
outlined in the previous section.
